# React D3 Geo Maps
Simple example of a D3 geo map in React.  This project includes code from M. Bostock and the D3 In Action book.

Under the static/ folder I have some D3 geo charts taken from bost.ocks.org that use d3 library directly.

Under src/ folder I have some D3 geo charts in React that use the npmjs D3 packages.
